<td class= "text-center"><h1 style="font-family: monospace; font-size: small;"><p>Ingredients: 2 cups water divided
    1/2 cup glutinous rice
    1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder or 2 tablea, 
    if available
    1/4 cup sugar
    1 teaspoon condensed milk or evaporated milk
    <br><br>

    Procedure: <br><br>
    1. Bring the water to a boil and remove ½ cup to a bowl. Add the rice to the remaining 1 ½ cups water, bring back to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer.
    <br> 2. Meanwhile, add the cocoa powder or chopped tablea to the hot water in the bowl. Mix to dissolve/melt and form a smooth paste. Add the mixture to the rice as it is cooking and mix through.
    <br> 3. Continue to cook the rice, uncovered, at a steady simmer, stirring now and then until the rice is just about cooked through - it should take around 12-18 minutes from when the rice came to a boil.
    <br> 4. Then, add in the sugar and mix to dissolve. Continue to cook for another 5 minutes to thicken slightly then remove from the heat and serve. Bear in mind that it will continue to thicken a little off the heat so you don't want it too thick when you remove from the heat.
    <br> 5. Divide between serving dishes and drizzle over a little condensed milk or evaporated milk to serve.</p></h1></td>

    <td class= "text-center"><h1 style="font-family: monospace; font-size: small;"><p>Ingredients: <br><br>1/4 cup warm water
1 packet active dry yeast
6 tablespoons white granulated sugar
3 tablespoons butter, softened
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup warm milk
1/2 cup mashed cooked ube
1 1/2 tablespoons liquid ube flavoring
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cups flour
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, for kneading
1/2 pound Velvetta cheese (or any quick melat cheese), cut into 14 two-inch and ¼-inch thick squares
1/2 cup bread crumbs

Procedure: <br><br>
1. In a mixing bowl, add the warm water (105 to 110 F in temperature) and sprinkle the active dry yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Stir the mixture and let stand for about 5 minutes, or until foamy.
<br> 2. Add the softened butter, eggs, the remaining sugar, warm milk, mashed purple yam, ube flavoring, and salt. With a wooden spoon, stir the ingredients until well combined.
<br> 3. Add 3 cups of the flour, one cup at a time, stirring well after each addition until the dough forms a shaggy mass. Add just enough of the remaining flour (you might not use the whole ½ cup) to manage stickiness and stir until the dough comes together in the center of the bowl.
<br> 4. Lightly grease a kneading board with the oil, and turn the dough out. Lightly grease hands with oil and knead the dough,  pushing the dough down and away from your body using the heels of your palms, until it's smooth and elastic but still somewhat tacky.
<br> 5. Place the kneaded dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a kitchen towel. Let rise for about 1 ½ to 2 hours or until double in size.
<br> 6. Gently deflate the risen dough and form it into a 20 to 22-inch log. Cut the log vertically in half and then cut each half into 7 smaller portions to yield 14 portions.
<br> 7. Using the palm of hands, flatten each dough portion and place a piece of cheese in the center. Fold the dough around the cheese and form it into a smooth ball, tucking the ends under to seal.
<br> 8. Roll the dough in bread crumbs and arrange in a single layer at about ½ inch apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
<br> 9. Cover loosely with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for about 30 to 60 minutes or until puffy and doubled in size.
<br> 10. Bake for about 20-23 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to slightly cool as the filling will be hot!
